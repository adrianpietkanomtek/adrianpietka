# Hi, my name is Adrian Pietka ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am *Software Engineer* who love code architecture. I am fan of CQRS and Hexagonal Architecture but it isn't only my one silver bullet for all problems to solve.

ðŸŽ¨ My current tool setup are: TypeScript / JavaScript / Node.js / Docker / AWS. Sometimes I must touch other programming languages like C# or PHP. I'm not ashamed of that, becouse I try get all positive things from different solutions to build best software for customer.

ðŸ’° I working as CTO who still programming at Emphie Solutions in Poland. It's my way not only to make money but also build very specific place for technical perfection. We work outside with global customers and build own SAAS solutions for chess players.

ðŸ”— In 2017 with my friend Mate we created *DevEnv*. It's polish website for programmers who want create better code and software. We are recording podcast, writting articles and create videos for our community at free.

ðŸ’¥ My hobby and passion is very weird, because I am interested from few year about Word War II military. Few times at year I am traveling to places related to military histor, like in Poland and rest of european countries.
