# Hi, my name is Adrian Pietka ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» I am **Software Engineer** who love code architecture. I am **fan of CQRS and Hexagonal Architecture** but it isn't only my one silver bullet for all problems to solve.

ðŸŽ¨ My current tool setup are: **TypeScript** / **JavaScript** / **Node.js** / **Docker** / **AWS**. Sometimes I must touch other programming languages like C# or PHP. I'm not ashamed of that, becouse I try get all positive things from different solutions to **build best software for customer**.
